# Introduction

Deploy Now is a hosting platform built from developers for developers. Connect your GitHub account with Deploy Now and get your web project live in seconds. Deploy Now updates your website on [IONOS](https://www.ionos.com/) shared hosting infrastructure after every git commit. The workflow automation is based on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

## Supported technologies

### Plain HTML and PHP websites
Deploy Now allows you to host static websites based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Your projects are served via Apache webserver. All files in your dist folder are transfered to IONOS just with git push. On top Deploy Now supports PHP. A dedicated support for PHP frameworks like Laraval and Symfony will be available in an alpha version soon.

### Static Site Generators
If you are working with static site generators, Deploy Now allows you to move static files to our infrastructure after every build based on the [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) pipeline. If you setup the build pipeline manually, all existing static site generators can be used. Deploy Now offers out of the box support for Gridsome, Gatsby, Hugo, Jekyll, Eleventy, Hexo and Metalsmith.

### Single Page Applications
You can deploy Single Page Applications based on frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, Svelte or Ionic.

### Not supported
Our hosting infastructure uses Apache webservers only. Thus, server-side rendering with Node.js is not supported. Besides, Deploy Now does not support databases. If you are missing one of these or any other technology, you can let us know by requesting a feature via the product dashboard.

## Getting started
You can start either [from sample](/docs/framework-samples), [from command line](/docs/from-cmd-line) or [from an existing repository](/docs/from-repo).
